description: All possible ways for our community to get in touch with ZenML.
---

The ZenML team and community have put together a list of references
that can be used to develop a deeper understanding of the framework.



## Slack Channel: Get help from the community 

The ZenML [Slack Channel](https://zenml.io/slack-invite) is the main gathering 
point for the community. Not only is it the best place to get in touch with the 
core team of ZenML, it is also a great way to discuss new ideas and share 
your own ZenML projects with the community. If you have a question, there is 
a high chance someone else might have already answered it on Slack!
