description: Use secrets across your ZenML pipeline.
---

Most projects involving either cloud infrastructure or of a certain complexity
will involve secrets of some kind. For example, you'll use secrets to connecting
to AWS, which requires an `access_key_id` and a `secret_access_key`. On your
local machine this is usually stored in your `~/.aws/credentials` file.
You might find you need to access those secrets from within your Kubernetes
cluster as it runs individual steps. You might also just want a centralized
location for the storage of secrets across your ZenML project. ZenML gives you
all this with the Secret Manager stack component.
